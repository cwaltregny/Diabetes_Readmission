# Predicting Diabetes Readmission

## Introduction

Readmission within 30 days after hospitalization indicates that inadequate treatment was provided to the patient during his time at the hospital. Hospital readmissions cost a lot to the healthcare system and one solution is to provide additional assistance to patients with high risk of readmission. Furthermore, patients affected with diabetes are more subjected to readmissions than other medical conditions and we will therefore focus on this population in the scope of this project.

The goal of this project is to predict if a patient with diabetes will be readmitted within 30 days after hospitalization.

## Dataset

The dataset used here represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes.

The dataset can be found in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008 and is taken from -- Beata Strack, Jonathan P. DeShazo, Chris Gennings, Juan L. Olmo, Sebastian Ventura, Krzysztof J. Cios, and John N. Clore, “Impact of HbA1c Measurement on Hospital Readmission Rates: Analysis of 70,000 Clinical Database Patient Records,” BioMed Research International, vol. 2014, Article ID 781670, 11 pages, 2014. --

## Method

I divided the project into 4 steps:
1. Problem Description
2. Data Analysis and Preparation
3. Modelling and Evaluation
4. Conclusion

Instead of just trying algorithms and see which perform best, I tried to understand which algorithm is best suited for this problem by exploring our data. I also assessed the added value of the method from a business perspective.
